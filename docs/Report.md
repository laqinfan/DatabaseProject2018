## Introduction

In this project, we designed and implemented a simplified taxicab system. In this taxicab system, there are some requirements: 1) Vehicles are identified by a vehicle-id, 2) each vehicle is owned by a driver, 3) customers are identified by email-id, 4) Customer and vehicle are tracked by GPS, 5) Customer can request a ride with specific vehicle, and give feedback to the ride, 6) Customer can apply coupons to a ride. Based on these requirements, we have the database design as follows.
